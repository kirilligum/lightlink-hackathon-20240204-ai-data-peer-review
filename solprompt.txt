i'm using remix.ethereum.org. create a solidity smart contract that does the following
set addresses for authors
set addresses for reviewers
reviewers submit a list of keywords that they are experts in
an author posts a data object containing question, response, and whatever meta data that is needed
the author runs a contract's function to find reviewers. 
the find_reviewers function finds how many reviewer's keywords are mentionned in the author's question and repsonse and finds 3 reviewers with the highest number of the mentions of their keywords
these reviewers now have to vote to accept or reject the data object
this voting is done using commit reveal process so that voters can't see the votes untill the end.
