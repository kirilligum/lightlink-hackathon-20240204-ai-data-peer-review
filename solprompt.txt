a solidity smart contract that does the following:
during the construction, sets the addresses of authors and reviewers, sets the license, and sets the ROI_FEE_DENOMINATOR
the reviewers themselves have to add a list of keywords that they are experts in
an author posts a data object containing question, response, and whatever meta data that is needed
the author runs a contract's function to find reviewers. 
the find_reviewers function finds how many reviewer's keywords are mentionned in the author's question and repsonse. then the find_reviewers function finds 3 reviewers with the highest number of the mentions of their keywords and assings those reviewers to review the data object
these reviewers now have to vote to accept or reject the data object using commit-reveal blind voting scheme. the correct answer is the majority vote. 
after all voters are revealed, based on a majority vote, mark the submission as approved or not approved 
create a function to show how the reviewers voted (after reveal)
