A Solidity smart contract that performs the following functions:

During construction, it sets the addresses of authors and reviewers, establishes the license, and sets the ROI_FEE_DENOMINATOR.
The reviewers are required to add a list of keywords in which they are experts.
An author posts a data object containing a question, a response, and any necessary metadata.
The author executes a function within the contract to find suitable reviewers.
The 'find_reviewers' function determines how many of a reviewer's keywords are mentioned in the author's question and response. It then selects the three reviewers with the highest number of keyword mentions and assigns them to review the data object.
These reviewers must then vote to accept or reject the data object using a commit-reveal blind voting scheme. The majority vote determines the correct answer.
After all votes are revealed, the submission is marked as approved or not approved based on the majority vote.
A function is created to display how the reviewers voted (post-reveal).
